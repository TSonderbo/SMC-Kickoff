# SMC-Kickoff

## Project Background

### Introduction
Noise can affect the listening experience when using headphones as it distracts from the audio coming from the headphone speakers.
Traffic is the main source of noise impact in Denmark. Traffic noise is present in most outdoor areas near roads and affects aproximately 1 in 3 houses (MST 2022). Some examples of sources of traffic are motorvehicles, trains & railways and airplanes.     
Active noise cancelation (ANC) can be used to reduce the percieved noise levels of traffic noise (Kang, Moon, Lim 2014). This involves using microphones to record noise from the environment and playing corresponding anti noise through speakers.      
Bang & Olufsen is a company that manufacturs headphones. They are interested in implementing ANC into their headphones.

### Problem Statement
How can noise be removed from the listening environment to enhance the listening experience, without affecting the quality of the sound? 

### Definition of purpose
The purpose of this project is to design an ANC algorithm that can reduced percieved traffic noise in headphones.

### Delimitation
This project will not design acoustic noise reduction.   
This project will not design headphones.

## Methodology
This project will use SCRUM as a development methodology.

## Risk assessment

## Analysis

## Requirements
This section contains the requirements determined for the project. The requirements are ordered in order of importance using MoSCoW.
### Functional Requirements
* Must be able to filter noise traffic noise (Cars, Trains, Airplanes etc.)

* Must able to adjust filtered amount of background noise

* Must be able to adjust which types of audio to filter

* Must be able to enable and disable noise filtering

* Should be able to enable and disable microphones
### Non-Functional Requirements
* Must be able to record audio from user

* Must be able to run wirelessly over Bluetooth 5.1 

* Must have a visual indicator that the product is turned on 

* Must have a visual indicator that the product is filtering audio 

* Must be power efficient
